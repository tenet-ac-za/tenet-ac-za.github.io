# tenet-ac-za.github.io

This repo, and the index.html file it contains, are a placeholder to
reduce the number of extraneous "vulnerability disclosures" we get for
tenet-ac-za.github.io. It is not expected to contain any legitimate
content, nor should any domain or webpage link to here directly. It
exists only because tenet-ac-za.github.io is used as a CNAME for other
pages on other domains hosted using Github Pages.
